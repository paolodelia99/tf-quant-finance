This doc describes an implementation of the
[ProcessedMarketData](https://github.com/paolodelia99/tf-quant-finance/blob/459f6ffabb85ba45088d826291b3c75d263e706a/tf_quant_finance/experimental/pricing_platform/framework/core/processed_market_data.py#L212)
interface where the supplied data is represented as a dictionary of numeric
values.

**IMPORTANT** The doc and the interface are under development and subject
to changes.

`ProcessedMarketData` object contains the minimal data necessary for instrument
pricing. It contains information about calibrated curves, volatility surfaces,
and historical fixings.

`MarketDataDict` is an implementation of `ProcessedMarketData` interface where
users are expected to supply market data as a nested dictionary in the following
format:

```python
{
  # Currencies
  'rates': {
    'USD': {
      'curves': {
        'risk_free_curve': {
           # Sorted tensor of dates
          'dates': [date1, date2]
          # Discount factors

        }
        'LIBOR_3M': {
           # Sorted tensor of discount dates
          'dates': [date1, date2]
          # Discount factors
          'discounts': [discount1, discount2]
          # Fixing source
          'fixings_source': 'LIBOR_3M'
          # Interpolation configuration

        }
      }
      'historical_fixings': {

          'fixing_dates': [fixing_date1, fixing_date2,
                           fixing_date3]
          # Fixing rates represented as annualized simple rates
          'fixing_rates': [rate1, rate2, rate3]
          # Fixing daycount. Should have a value that is one of
          # the `core.DayCountConventions`. Must be supplied if
          # the fixings are specified
          'fixing_daycount': 'ACTUAL_360'
          # Business day convention
          'business_convention': 'FOLLOWING'

        # Option expiry
        "expriries": [date1, date2]
        # Swap tenors for each expiry. In each row, the last value
        # can be repeated
        "tenors": 2d array
        # Strikes for each `tenors` entry.
        "strikes": 3d array
        # Implied volatilities corresponding to each `strikes` entry
        "implied_volatilities": 3d array
        # Interpolation configuration
        'config': volatility_config
        }
      'CAP': {
       â€¦.
       }
      }
    }
  }
  # Equities

        "spot_price": 1700
        "historical_spot_prices": {

        }
        "currency": "USD"
        "volatility_surface": {
          "dates": [date1, date2]
          # Strikes for each date. In each row, the last value can
          # be repeated, e.g,
          # [[1650, 1700, 1750, 1800, 1800],
          #  [1650, 1700, 1750, 1770, 1790]]
          "strikes": 2d array
          # Implied volatilities corresponding to the dates and
          # strikes.
          "implied_volatilities": 2d array
          # Interpolation configuration
          'config': volatility_config
        }
      }
    }
  }
# Snapshot date
"reference_date": date
}
```

Each top-level key of the dictionary refers to a member of an asset
class. This can be a rate, equity, commodity, etc. Above only rates and equities
are included. `reference_date` refers to the snapshot date.

Below we specify rates and equity classes specifications.

## Rates

*   Top level of a rate object corresponds to a currency. For example, `USD`
    above. Each currency has associated rate curves (e.g., LIBOR above), fixings
    and volatility cubes.

*   `curves` should contain a dictionary of curve specification that are needed
    for pricing. Available keys are the proto name fields of
    [`RateIndexType`](https://github.com/paolodelia99/tf-quant-finance/blob/ad8bf1ab3a834f09dab1211720c7d0eb796bd816/tf_quant_finance/experimental/pricing_platform/instrument_protos/rate_indices.proto#L31).
    Additionally, `risk_free_curve` should be supplied, which is the default
    discounting curve. Curves are represented via discount factors and
    corresponding `dates` (**TODO: add relatives dates `rdates` alternative**).
    In order to add a missing curve type, simply add it as a new field in
    [`RateIndexType`](https://github.com/paolodelia99/tf-quant-finance/blob/ad8bf1ab3a834f09dab1211720c7d0eb796bd816/tf_quant_finance/experimental/pricing_platform/instrument_protos/rate_indices.proto#L31)

*   Fixings can be supplied for each curve using `fixing_rates`, `fixing_dates`,
    and `fixing_daycount` fields (available day count conventions are listed in
    the
    [`DayCountConvention`](https://github.com/paolodelia99/tf-quant-finance/blob/ad8bf1ab3a834f09dab1211720c7d0eb796bd816/tf_quant_finance/experimental/pricing_platform/instrument_protos/daycount_conventions.proto#L22)
    proto). If the fields are not supplied, fixings are assumed to be equal to
    zero. Otherwise, fixings are treated as a piecewise constant function for
    the dates that are not supplied with `fixing_dates`

Additional curve configuration (e.g., day count convention interpolation method,
etc) and customization should be supplied via the configuration dictionaries
`curve_config` and `volatility_config` (see Market data config section below).

*   `volatility_cube` contains volatility cube information. There can be
    different cube types, e.g., 'SWAPTION' or 'CAP' above (**TODO: standardize
    volatility cube types**). Each cube consists of a vector of option expiries
    an array of `tenors`, and a cube of `strikes` and the corresponding
    `implied_volatilities`.

## Equities

Top level contains `currency` name which gather all associated equities. (e.g.,
`GOOG` above). Users have to specify `spot_price`,
`volatility_surface` (represented as `strikes`, `dates` and
`implied_volatilities`) and, if needed, `historical_spots` data.

## Market data config

Market data configuration allows users to specify the interpolation methods and
day count conventions. Currently the following format is supported

```python
curve_config = {"interpolation_method": "LINEAR",
                "interpolate_rates": False,
                "daycount_convention": "ACTUAL_365",
                # Business day convention
                'business_convention': 'FOLLOWING',
                # Holiday calendar
                'holiday_calendar': 'US'}
```

where `interpolation_method` is one of the supported
[methods](https://github.com/paolodelia99/tf-quant-finance/blob/ad8bf1ab3a834f09dab1211720c7d0eb796bd816/tf_quant_finance/experimental/pricing_platform/framework/core/interpolation_method.py#L20),
`interpolate_rates` is a boolean that specifies whether the interpolation is
performed in a rates or discount factor space, `daycount_convention` is one of
the supported
[conventions](https://github.com/paolodelia99/tf-quant-finance/blob/ad8bf1ab3a834f09dab1211720c7d0eb796bd816/tf_quant_finance/experimental/pricing_platform/instrument_protos/daycount_conventions.proto#L22),
`business_convention` is one of [BusinessDayConvention](https://github.com/paolodelia99/tf-quant-finance/blob/53bb1edc345855f625b392ff5831aeadec04c3ff/tf_quant_finance/experimental/pricing_platform/instrument_protos/business_days.proto#L22),
and `holiday_calendar` is a [BankHoliday](https://github.com/paolodelia99/tf-quant-finance/blob/53bb1edc345855f625b392ff5831aeadec04c3ff/tf_quant_finance/experimental/pricing_platform/instrument_protos/business_days.proto#L52).

By default cubic interpolation is used in the discount factor space with
`ACTUAL_365` day count convention.

For the volatility surface/cube day count, business days and calendar
specifications are supported.

```python
curve_config = {"daycount_convention": "ACTUAL_365",
                # Business day convention
                'business_convention': 'FOLLOWING',
                # Holiday calendar
                'holiday_calendar': 'US'}
```

## Fixings

Fixing information for rates/spots should be provided either via the market data
or via the instrument definition. The fixing information can be updated via
metadata supplied at the instrument pricing stage. For example, consider the
following diagram

\begin{tikzpicture}[node distance=4.5cm, auto]
% Place nodes
\node [rectangle, draw, fill=blue!20, text width=7em, text centered,
       rounded corners, minimum height=4em](market_data) {market\_data};
\node [rectangle, draw, fill=blue!20, text width=7em, text centered,
       rounded corners, minimum height=4em, right of=market_data](market_data_1) {market\_data\_1};
\node [rectangle, draw, fill=blue!20, text width=7em, text centered,
       rounded corners, minimum height=4em, right of=market_data_1](market_data_2) {market\_data\_2};
\node [rectangle, draw, fill=blue!20, text width=7em, text centered,
       rounded corners, minimum height=4em, below of=market_data_1, node distance=2.5cm](price_1) {price\_1};
\node [rectangle, draw, fill=blue!20, text width=7em, text centered,
       rounded corners, minimum height=4em, below of=market_data_2, node distance=2.5cm](price_2) {price\_2};
\node [rectangle, draw, fill=blue!20, text width=7em, text centered,
       rounded corners, minimum height=4em, below of=market_data_2, node distance=2.5cm](price_2) {price\_2};
\node [rectangle,
draw, fill=blue!20, text width=15em, text centered, rounded corners, minimum
height=4em, below of=price_1, node distance=2.5cm, right=0cm](aggregate) {aggregate(price\_1, price\_2)};
% Draw edges
\path [draw, -latex](market_data) -- (market_data_1); \path
[draw, -latex](market_data_1) -- (market_data_2); \path
[draw, -latex](market_data_1) -- (price_1); \path
[draw, -latex](market_data_2) -- (price_2); \path [draw, -latex](price_1) --
(aggregate); \path [draw, -latex](price_2) -- (aggregate); \path
[draw, -latex](price_1) -- node {metadata}(price_2);

\end{tikzpicture}

Here market data is evolved twice and the pricing is performed at each stage.
Fixings can either be a part of the market data or supplied separately via
pricing
[`config`](https://github.com/paolodelia99/tf-quant-finance/blob/ad8bf1ab3a834f09dab1211720c7d0eb796bd816/tf_quant_finance/experimental/pricing_platform/framework/core/instrument.py#L58).
For example, `config` may contain a knock-out event for a barrier option.
Metadata is used by the pricing method via the configuration field

```python
Instrument.from_protos(proto_list,
                       config=InstrumentConfig(**metadata))
```

By default, the pricing method should check if instrument metadata contains the
requested fixing data and, otherwise, use market data to extract the fixings.
